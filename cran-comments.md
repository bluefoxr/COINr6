## Resubmission

This is a resubmission v.0.6.1 to very recent v.0.6.0. I can see that CRAN tests have thrown two errors because I have used the native pipe |> in a few places in updates. I have now removed the native pipe to keep the R version dependency at 4.0. Sorry about that.

Updates are described in NEWS.md.
There were no errors or warnings (see below).
