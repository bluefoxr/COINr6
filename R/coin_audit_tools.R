# EXTENDED AUDITING TOOLS

#' Check the effect of removing indicators or aggregates
#'
#' This is an analysis function for seeing what happens when elements of the composite indicator are removed. This can help with "what if"
#' experiments and acts as different measure of the influence of each indicator or aggregate.
#'
#' One way of looking at indicator "importance" in a composite indicator is via correlations. A different way is to see what happens if we
#' remove the indicator completely from the framework. If removing an indicator or a whole aggregation of indicators results in very little
#' rank change, it is one indication that perhaps it is not necessary to include it. Emphasis on *one*: there may be many other things to take
#' into account.
#'
#' This function works by successively setting the weight of each indicator or aggregate to zero. If the analysis is performed at the indicator
#' level, it creates a copy of the COIN, sets the weight of the first indicator to zero, regenerates the results, and compares to the nominal
#' results (results when no weights are set to zero). It repeats this for each indicator in turn, such that each time one indicator is set to
#' zero weights, and the others retain their original weights. The output is a series of tables comparing scores and ranks (see Value).
#'
#' Note that "removing the indicator" here means more precisely "setting its weight to zero". In most cases the first implies the second,
#' but check that the aggregation method that you are using satisfies this relationship. For example, if the aggregation method does not
#' use any weights, then setting the weight to zero will have no effect.
#'
#' @param COIN The COIN, which must be constructed up to and including the aggregation step.
#' @param aglev The level at which to remove elements. For example, `aglev = 1` would check the effect of removing each indicator, one at
#' a time. `aglev = 2` would check the effect of removing each of the aggregation groups above the indicator level, one at a time.
#' @param isel A character string indicating the indicator or aggregate code to extract from each iteration. I.e. normally this would be set to
#' the index code to compare the ranks of the index upon removing each indicator or aggregate. But it can be any code that is present in
#' `.$Data$Aggregated`.
#' @param quietly Logical: if FALSE (default) will output to the console an indication of progress. Might be useful when iterating over many
#' indicators. Otherwise set to TRUE to shut this up.
#'
#' @examples
#' # check the effect of removing ASEM sub-pillars, one at a time
#' # First build ASEM index
#' ASEM <- build_ASEM()
#' # now run check at sub-index level (level 3), on index scores/ranks
#' CheckPillars <- removeElements(ASEM, 3, "Index")
#' # summary by pillar
#' CheckPillars$MeanAbsDiff
#' # have a look at the rest of the output list to see more details.
#'
#' @return A list with elements as follows:
#' * `.$Scores`: a data frame where each column is the scores for each unit, with indicator/aggregate corresponding to the column name removed.
#' E.g. `.$Scores$Ind1` gives the scores resulting from removing "Ind1".
#' * `.$Ranks`: as above but ranks
#' * `.$RankDiffs`: as above but difference between nominal rank and rank on removing each indicator/aggregate
#' * `.$RankAbsDiffs`: as above but absolute rank differences
#' * `.$MeanAbsDiffs`: as above, but the mean of each column. So it is the mean (over units) absolute rank change resulting from removing each
#' indicator or aggregate.
#'
#' @seealso
#' * [compTable()] Comparison table between two COINs
#' * [compTableMulti()] Comparison table between multiple COINs
