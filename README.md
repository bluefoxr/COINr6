This is an archived version of [COINr](https://github.com/bluefoxr/COINr) which can be installed as a separate package called "COINr6".

After COINr 0.6.1, major changes in syntax and functionality were introduced. This was a one-off abrupt change to improve the package but is obviously disruptive. For users who would prefer to continue using the old version, or would like to use both the old and new versions simultaneously, I have archived COINr v.0.6.1 here under the name "COINr6". By naming the package differently, it can be installed alongside the new COINr if needed.

To install, run:

```{r InstallCOINr, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("bluefoxr/COINr6")
```
