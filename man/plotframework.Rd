\title{Interactive sunburst plot of index structure}
\usage{
plotframework(COIN, seg_cols = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{COIN}{COIN object, or list with first entry is the indicator metadata, second entry is the aggregation metadata}

\item{seg_cols}{A character vector of colour codes, one for each segment in the plot. The length of this
vector must be equal to the number of segments, i.e. the sum of the number of indicators and aggregates
in each level.}
}
\value{
Interactive sunburst plot built using \strong{plotly}. This can be edited further with \strong{plotly} commands.
}
\description{
Plots the structure of the index using a sunburst plot using \strong{plotly}. Output can be used as an interactive plot
in html documents, e.g. via R Markdown.
}
\details{
Note that this plot is sensitive to the \emph{order} of the elements. If you use \code{\link[=assemble]{assemble()}} and input
a COIN, this plot should work automatically. If you input a list, you should make sure that the indicator metadata
is ordered by descending order of the hierarchy (i.e. highest level, working downwards).

\examples{
# build ASEM COIN
ASEM <- assemble(IndData = ASEMIndData, IndMeta = ASEMIndMeta, AggMeta = ASEMAggMeta)
# plot framework
plotframework(ASEM)
