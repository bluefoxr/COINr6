\title{Plot ranks from an uncertainty/sensitivity analysis}
\usage{
plotSARanks(
  SAresults,
  plot_units = NULL,
  order_by = "nominal",
  dot_colour = NULL,
  line_colour = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SAresults}{A list of sensitivity/uncertainty analysis results from \code{\link[=sensitivity]{sensitivity()}}.}

\item{plot_units}{A character vector of units to plot. Defaults to all units. You can also set
to \code{"top10"} to only plot top 10 units, and \code{"bottom10"} for bottom ten.}

\item{order_by}{If set to \code{"nominal"}, orders the rank plot by nominal ranks
(i.e. the original ranks prior to the sensitivity analysis). Otherwise if \code{"median"}, orders by
median ranks.}

\item{dot_colour}{Colour of dots representing median ranks.}

\item{line_colour}{Colour of lines connecting 5th and 95th percentiles.}
}
\value{
A plot of rank confidence intervals, generated by 'ggplot2'.
}
\description{
Plots the ranks resulting from an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, in particular plots
the median, and 5th/95th percentiles of ranks.
}
\details{
To use this function you first need to run \code{\link[=sensitivity]{sensitivity()}}. Then enter the resulting list as the
\code{SAresults} argument here. See \href{https://bluefoxr.github.io/COINrDoc/sensitivity-analysis.html}{COINr online documentation}
for more details.

# build ASEM COIN up to aggregation

# run uncertainty analysis
# here we set N deliberately much lower than normal to enable quick testing
# Would recommend in a practical case to increase to perhaps 500 (more is always better)
